fulltext = "She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had notbeen lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the jar madeher catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his coldlittle nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed thatthe house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in atthe window, flooding the little room. She sprang from her bed and with Toto ather heels ran and opened the door.The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growingbigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.The cyclone had set the house down very gently--for a cyclone--in the midstof a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of greensward allabout, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks of gorgeousflowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sangand fluttered in the trees and bushes. A little way off was a small brook,rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voicevery grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, shenoticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen.They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to; butneither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy,who was a well-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looksgo, many years older.Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They woreround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bellsaround the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men wereblue; the little womans hat was white, and she wore a white gown that hung inpleats from her shoulders. Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened inthe sun like diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade astheir hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops.The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of themhad beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face wascovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in thedoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to comefarther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow andsaid, in a sweet voice:You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. Weare so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and forsetting our people free from bondage.Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little womanpossibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the WickedWitch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had beencarried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killedanything in all her life.But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, withhesitation, You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have notkilled anything.Your house did, anyway, replied the little old woman, with a laugh, and thatis the same thing. See! she continued, pointing to the corner of the house.There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood.Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just under thecorner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shodin silver shoes with pointed toes.Oh, dear! Oh, dear! cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay.The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?There is nothing to be done, said the little woman calmly.But who was she? asked Dorothy.She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said, answered the little woman.She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making themslave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to youfor the favor.Who are the Munchkins? inquired Dorothy.They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witchruled.Are you a Munchkin? asked Dorothy.No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North. When theysaw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger tome, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.Oh, gracious! cried Dorothy. Are you a real witch?Yes, indeed, answered the little woman. But I am a good witch, and thepeople love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who ruledhere, or I should have set the people free myself.But I thought all witches were wicked, said the girl, who was half frightenedat facing a real witch. Oh, no, that is a great mistake. There were only fourwitches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the Northand the South, are good witches. I know this is true, for I am one of themmyself, and cannot be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East and the Westwere, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one of them, thereis but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz--the one who lives in the West.But, said Dorothy, after a moments thought, Aunt Em has told me that thewitches were all dead--years and years ago.Who is Aunt Em? inquired the little old woman.She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed andher eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, I do not know whereKansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before. But tell me, isit a civilized country?Oh, yes, replied Dorothy.Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there are nowitches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But, you see, theLand of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of theworld. Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us.Who are the wizards? asked Dorothy.Oz himself is the Great Wizard, answered the Witch, sinking her voice to awhisper. He is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He lives in theCity of Emeralds.Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins, whohad been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner ofthe house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.What is it? asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to laugh. Thefeet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but thesilver shoes.She was so old, explained the Witch of the North, that she dried up quicklyin the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are yours, and you shallhave them to wear. She reached down and picked up the shoes, and aftershaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes, said one of theMunchkins, and there is some charm connected with them; but what it is wenever knew.Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Thenshe came out again to the Munchkins and said:I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will worryabout me. Can you help me find my way?The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy,and then shook their heads.At the East, not far from here, said one, there is a great desert, and nonecould live to cross it.It is the same at the South, said another, for I have been there and seen it.The South is the country of the Quadlings.I am told, said the third man, that it is the same at the West. And thatcountry, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West,who would make you her slave if you passed her way.The North is my home, said the old lady, and at its edge is the same greatdesert that surrounds this Land of Oz. Im afraid, my dear, you will have tolive with us.Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strangepeople. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for theyimmediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also. As for thelittle old woman, she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of hernose, while she counted One, two, three in a solemn voice. At once the capchanged to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks:LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDSThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the wordson it, asked, Is your name Dorothy, my dear?Yes, answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.Where is this city? asked Dorothy.It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the Great WizardI told you of.Is he a good man? inquired the girl anxiously.He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I havenever seen him.How can I get there? asked Dorothy.You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimespleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all the magicarts I know of to keep you from harm.Wont you go with me? pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon thelittle old woman as her only friend.No, I cannot do that, she replied, but I will give you my kiss, and no onewill dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North.She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where herlips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found outsoon after.The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick, said the Witch,so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him, but tellyour story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy afriendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and straightwaydisappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who barked after her loudlyenough when she had gone, because he had been afraid even to growl whileshe stood by.But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear in justthat way, and was not surprised in the least."
