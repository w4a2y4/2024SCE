        "Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmers wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, threeor four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in onecorner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all,and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar,where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mightyenough to crush any building in its path.",
        "It was reached by a trap door in themiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothingbut the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broadsweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. Thesun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks runningthrough it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of thelong blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Oncethe house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rainswashed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun andwind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and leftthem a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and theywere gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy,who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by thechilds laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heartwhenever Dorothys merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at thelittle girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and didnot know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his roughboots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray asher other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with longsilky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of hisfunny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, andloved him dearly.Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstepand looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothystood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Emwas washing the dishes.From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry andDorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the comingstorm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as theyturned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from thatdirection also.Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.Theres a cyclone coming, Em, he called to his wife. Ill go look after thestock. Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept.Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of thedanger close at hand.Quick, Dorothy! she screamed. Run for the cellar!Toto jumped out of Dorothys arms and hid under the bed, and the girl startedto get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in the floorand climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy caught Toto atlast and started to follow her aunt. When she was halfway across the roomthere came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that shelost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.Then a strange thing happened.The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air.Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exactcenter of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, butthe great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higherand higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it remainedand was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather.It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy foundshe was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one othertime when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently,like a baby in a cradle.Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there, barkingloudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what wouldhappen.Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the little girlthought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up throughthe hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he couldnot fall. She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into theroom again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents couldhappen.Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but shefelt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearlybecame deaf. At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces whenthe house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, shestopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future wouldbring. At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay downupon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her.In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soonclosed her eyes and fell fast asleep."

        ["Wow, Kansas sounds like a really quiet place to live, doesn't it? What kind of things do you think Dorothy does for fun around there?",
         "Yes, that's right! Dorothy spends her days playing with Toto and helping her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry with chores. There isn’t much to do, so she has a lot of time to imagine adventures!",
         "You know, it can be tough to find things to do in such a quiet place, but Dorothy loves spending time with her dog Toto and daydreaming about far-off lands. She makes her own fun with the little she has around her."

         "Toto seems like such a loyal buddy to Dorothy, right? Do you remember having a pet or a special friend who was always by your side? What were they like?",
         "Absolutely, Toto is more than just a pet to Dorothy; he’s her best friend. They have a really special bond, don't they?",
         "Toto is really important to Dorothy because he's her only companion in Kansas. It's okay if you can’t recall having a pet or friend like that; everyone’s experiences are different. Toto is like a little guardian for Dorothy."
